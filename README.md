# CONVOLUTION-OPERATION-Project

## Computer Architecture (CO2008) Assignment

### Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), focusing on the core convolution operation used in deep learning for image processing tasks. CNNs are widely applied in fields like image classification, object detection, and pattern recognition. In this project, the convolution operation, along with techniques like zero-padding and stride control, are used to extract features from input data. This serves as the foundation for building more advanced computer vision applications using deep learning.

### Installation and Running the Project
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install MARS MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LongVoBI/CONVOLUTION-OPERATION-Project.git
3.Unzip sample_test_ca.
4.Create Test_case and output folders (these will save our sample test and output files).
5.Run the mips5.asm file.
6.Update the input_file and output_file lines at 3 and 4 to match the paths of the Test_case and output folders.
7.Run the ASM and check the output with the zip file.
